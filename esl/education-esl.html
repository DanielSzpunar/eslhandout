                <p><b>1.) Are you in school? Are you a student (both questions have the same meaning.)?</b></p>
                <p><em>Yes, I'm currently <span style="color:#a64dff">enrolled</span> at the University of Toronto.</em></p>
                <p><b>2.) What is your best subject? What is your strongest subject? (both questions have the same meaning.)</b></p>
                <p><em>When I was a high school student my strongest subject was science.</em></p>
                <p><b>3.) What is your worst subject? What is your weakest subject? (both questions have the same meaning.)</b></p>
                <p><em>When I was a high school student my weakest subject was French.</em></p>
                <p><b>4.) What elementary school did you attend? What high school did you attend?</b></p>
                <p><em>I went to St. Jerome Catholic elementary school. I attended St. Martins Catholic Secondary school.</em></p>
                <p><b>5.) What university do you go to? Which university do you attend? (both questions have the same meaning.)</b></p>
                <p><em> I go to the University of Toronto.</em></p>
                <p><b>6.) Will you <span style="color:#a64dff">pursue</span> a masters or a <span style="color:#a64dff">doctorate</span> in your field? </b></p>
                <p><em>I don't think the benefits of obtaining a masters or doctorate degree outweigh the costs and time associated with <span style="color:#a64dff">acquiring</span> one.</em></p>
                <p><b>7.) Did you attend an all boys / girls school? Or did you attend a co-ed school.</b></p>
                <p><em>I always attended a school with both male and female students. So, I attended a <span style="color:#a64dff">co-ed</span> school.</em></p>
                <p><b>8.) Were you a member of any <span style="color:#a64dff">extracurricular</span> activities? If so, which?</b></p>
                <p><em>I was a member of the high school football and soccer team.  I enjoyed athletics.</em></p>
                <p><b>9.) Were you a good student?  Were you a good student academically? (What's the difference between these two questions?)</b></p>
                <p><em>I was a good student.  However, I wasn't very good <span style="color:#a64dff">academically</span>.</em></p>
                <p><b>10.) Is your university renowned for any programs?</b></p>
                <p><em>The University of Toronto is renowned for it's medical degree program.  Some of the best doctors in Canada graduate from the University of Toronto. </em></p>
                <p><b>11.) What's your major? What are you majoring in? (Both questions have the same meaning.)</b></p>
                <p><em>I have a double major in political science and historical studies.</em></p>
                <p><b>12.) Growing up, did you take part in (participate in) any after school activities?</b></p>
                <p><em>I attended a math academy after school to boost my low grades in algebra.</em></p>
                <p><b>13.) Were you ever <span style="color:#a64dff">bullied</span> by your classmates? Were you ever a bully?</b></p>
                <p><em>Luckily I wasn't bullied.  I also never bullied anyone. I always <span style="color:#a64dff"> stood up for</span> people who were bullied.</em></p><br>

                <p><b>1.) Does your major have a high success rate for <span style="color:#a64dff">job placement</span>? (Is it easy to get a job after graduation?)</b></p>
                <p><em>Actually, majoring in history and political science has a very low success rate for finding work following graduation.</em></p>
                <p><b>2.) Did your major offer an internship program?  If so, did you become an intern? Tell us about it.</b></p>
                <p><em>No, my major didn't have an internship.  In Canada, usually business majors and science majors have opportunities to become interns.</em></p>
                <p><b>3.) Did you develop any <span style="color:#a64dff">lasting relationships</span> with any teachers or professors over the years?</b></p>
                <p><em>I didn't become very close with any teachers.  However, I did develop a lasting relationship with one of my professors from university.  We keep in contact and usually have lunch a few times a year.</em></p>
                <p><b>4.) What led you to pursuing your major?  Do you have any <span style="color:#a64dff">regrets</span> with your decision?</b></p>
                <p><em>It was the only program from the university of Toronto that would except me. I <span style="color:#a64dff">initially</span> wanted to get a degree in business but my grades were <span style="color:#a64dff">insufficient</span>.</em></p>
                <p><b>5.) Do you prefer lecture based classes or <span style="color:#a64dff">hands on</span> classes?</b></p>
                <p><em>I prefer hands on classes.  However, universities  in Canada are mostly lecture based, where you sit in a lecture hall and just listen to the professor <span style="color:#a64dff">ramble</span> on and on.</em></p>

                <p><b>1.) Does your university, or government offer any assistance in job placement following graduation? If so, was it helpful?</b></p>
                <p><em>Actually, the first two years following graduation, my university helps students with job placement.  However, there are no guarantees! </em></p>
                <p><b>2.) Do you have any <span style="color:#a64dff">credentials</span> other than your degree that will assist you in finding work?</b></p>
                <p><em>Yes, I have experience with programming and analyzing data,  I am certified with Microsoft Office, and I have over 500 hours of volunteer work with my local hospital. </em></p>
                <p><b>3.) What degrees are in <span style="color:#a64dff">high demand</span> for jobs in your country? </b></p>
                <p><em>Many jobs in the tech industry are in high demand.  Specifically, jobs related to programming and telecommunications.  However, the pay isn't that great.</em></p>
                <p><b>4.) Will your salary be enough to support a family, or will it require your partner to also work (<span style="color:#a64dff">duel income family</span>)?</b></p>
                <p><em>In Canada,  new positions in almost all fields aren't enough to support a family with children on a single income.  So duel income households have become a <span style="color:#a64dff">necessity</span> to provide a <span style="color:#a64dff">high standard of living</span>.</em></p>

                <h4 class="babolevel"><span style="color:#9579cb">Tips:</span></h4><br>
                <p>1.) Remember: "I <span style="color:#86cb79">major in</span> _______." or "<span style="color:#86cb79">I'm a</span> _____ <span style="color:#86cb79">major</span>." Don't say: "<span style="color:#cb7986">I'm</span> ______ <span style="color:#cb7986">major</span>."  So many students make this strange mistake.</p>
                <p>2.) Remember: "<span style="color:#86cb79">I'm a</span> Seoul National University <span style="color:#86cb79">student</span>." Or "<span style="color:#86cb79">I'm a student at</span> Seoul National University." Don't say: "<span style="color:#cb7986">I'm</span> Seoul National University." This is also a very common mistake among students. Remember, you are not a university; you are a student.</p>
                <p>3.) Don't say: "I'm a fourth <span style="color:#cb7986">grade</span> university student." This is incorrect. Instead, say : "I'm a <span style="color:#86cb79">fourth year</span> university student." Grades are used for elementary, middle and high school, not university.</p>
                <p>4.) When you take a test, you get a "score".  All your test results combined make your overall "grade". Therefore, "I didn't score well on my last exam but my overall grade is good." Just remember your score is the number. For examples, I got 7/10.  My score was "7".  The grade is the letter. For example, since I got a 7/10 my grade is a C-.   </p><br>
