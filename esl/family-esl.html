                <br>
                <h4 class="correct">Beginner:</h4>
                <p><b>1.) How many <span style="color:#a64dff">siblings</span> do you have?</b></p>
                <p><em>I have one brother who is three years my senior.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>2.) Are you an <span style="color:#a64dff">only child</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>Nope, I have an older brother.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>3.) Were you the first born?</b></p>
                <p><em>No, I was the second born.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>4.) Who is your best friend?  Is he close like a brother / sister?</b></p>
                <p><em>My best friend is Jay.  Even though  I've only known him for a short time he's like a brother to me.  He's quite caring and funny.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>5.) Growing up, who <span style="color:#a64dff">raised you</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>My mother raised me since my father worked full-time.  In the summer I lived with my grandparents in Poland.  So, they raised me as well.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>6.) Who are you closest to in your family?</b></p>
                <p><em>I'm closest with my father.  My mother and I are actually very <span style="color:#a64dff"> distant</span>.  Our personalities clash, and we don't get along well.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>7.) Do you have a close relationship with your <span style="color:#a64dff">extended family</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>Actually I don't have a close relationship with my extended family.  All of my cousins, aunts, and uncles live in Europe.  So I've only met them on several occasions.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>8.) What <span style="color:#a64dff">qualities</span> do you value the most in friends?</b></p>
                <p><em>Loyalty is most important to me.  It's good to know when someone has your back.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>9.) How do you maintain the friendships you have?  How often do you see your friends?</b></p>
                <p><em>the older I get the harder it is to  keep good relations with friends.  I try to remember important dates like birthdays and see them once a month.  Even if I don't see them in months it's like I saw them yesterday when we finally do meet.</em></p>

                <br>
                <h4 class="correct">Intermediate:</h4>
                <p><b>1.) Who <span style="color:#a64dff">wears the pants</span> in your family? Who is the <span style="color:#a64dff">bread-winner</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>My mom wears the pants in my family.  She is definitely the boss of the house.  However, my father is the bread-winner. He's always working overtime and <span style="color:#a64dff">bringing home the bacon</span>.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>2.) Is it important for families to have <span style="color:#a64dff">duel incomes</span>? What is your, and your cultures opinion of <span style="color:#a64dff">stay-at-home dads</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>Nowadays, it's quite common for both parents to work. Growing up in Canada it wasn't always necessary for both parents to work but recently it's quite common.  Stay-at-home dads are definitely not as common as stay-at-home mom's but they are out there.  Part of being a man is still about supporting your family, so I think most men would like to work if given the opportunity.  </em></p>
              
                <p><b>3.) Who do you turn to for advice, your family or friends?</b></p>
                <p><em>I always <span style="color:#a64dff">turn to</span> my friends, even for very sensitive issues.  My parents are both very conservative so I don't want them to worry about me.</em></p>
            
                <p><b>4.) Do you or did your parents push you to <span style="color:#a64dff">follow in their footsteps</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>My father was a butcher.  So he really wanted me to do something else with my life and not follow in his footsteps.  I still deeply respect him though.  </em></p>

                <h4 class="correct">Advanced:</h4>
                <p><b>1.) What is the most important thing you've learned from your parents?</b></p>
                <p><em>My mother taught me to never settle for less.  If you want something go out and get it.  My father taught me to work hard and be patient.  Good things take time to come to <span style="color:#a64dff">fruition</span>.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>2.) If you decide to have your own family one-day, what would you do differently from your parents with regards to <span style="color:#a64dff">childrearing</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>My parents never really stressed the importance of a good education. Rather they wanted me to work at an early age instead of studying and better myself academically.  I want to make sure my children understand the importance of an education.</em></p>
                
                <p><b>3.) Would you like to <span style="color:#a64dff">rekindle</span> some friendships from the past that have <span style="color:#a64dff">grown apart</span> over the years?</b></p>
                <p><em>I would definitely like to rekindle a few relationships that have grown apart over the years. However, with age, people have their own families and lives so I can understand why things are the way they are. </em></p><img src="../img/family1.jpg" class="pic img-responsive img-rounded pic" alt="A picture of a Korean family.">
