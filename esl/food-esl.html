                <p><b>1.) What can I get you?</b></p>
                <p><em> I'll have a cheeseburger <span style="color:#a64dff">with everything</span>, along with a beer, please.</em></p>
                <p><b>2.) What did you eat (have) for lunch?</b></p>
                <p><em>I had a cheeseburger with fries and a beer for lunch. </em></p>
                <p><b>3.) Do you want to go out for dinner?</b></p>
                <p><em>Sure I'd love to what did you <span style="color:#a64dff">have in mind</span>?</em></p>
                <p><b>4.) <span style="color:#a64dff">Are you up for</span> drinks tonight?</b></p>
                <p><em>I can't go for drinks tonight.  I have to get an early start on tomorrow. I've got a busy day planned.</em></p>
                <p><b>5.) <span style="color:#a64dff">Where's a good place</span> to go for seafood in your  area? </b></p>
                <p><em>I know of a good place called Koo Koo Sushi located in the heart of downtown.  It's a popular <span style="color:#a64dff">buffet</span> restaurant.</em></p>
                <p><b>6.) What's your favorite <span style="color:#a64dff">cuisine</span>? How about your favorite <span style="color:#a64dff">dish</span>? </b></p>
                <p><em>I'm a <span style="color:#a64dff">die-hard fan of</span>  Japanese cuisine, especially ramen.  It's definitely my favorite dish.</em></p>
                <p><b>7.) Are there any foods or dishes you <span style="color:#a64dff">can't stand</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>I can't stand porridge and anything with peanuts, since I'm allergic to peanuts.</em></p>
                <p><b>8.) How often do you <span style="color:#a64dff">eat out</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>I only eat out on the weekends.  I can't afford eating out all the time.</em></p>
                <p><b>9.) Do you <span style="color:#a64dff">pack your</span> own <span style="color:#a64dff">lunch</span> to work or school?</b></p>
                <p><em>I don't pack a lunch to work.  My company has a cafeteria and the foods not bad so I always eat at work.</em></p><br>

                <h4 class="correct">Intermediate:</h4>
                <p><b>1.)  What is your <span style="color:#a64dff">specialty</span>? Can you make any fancy dishes <span style="color:#a64dff">from scratch</span>?</b></p>
                <p><em>I'm not a good cook. However, I recently <span style="color:#a64dff">enrolled</span> in a cooking class.  The only thing I can make <span style="color:#a64dff">from scratch</span> is apple pie, but it's not that difficult to make and only has a few ingredients.</em></p>
                <p><b>2.) What's your drink of choice when it comes to alcohol? Have you ever been <span style="color:#a64dff">cut-off</span>? </b></p>
                <p><em>My preferred drink of choice is beer, anything on tap, as a matter of fact. I also drink vodka-cranberry once in a while. I've always been a moderate drinker and never a heavy drinker, so no; I've never been cut-off. </em></p>
                <p><b>3.) What are the most popular dishes in your country and what side dishes or beverages <span style="color:#a64dff">complement</span> them well?</b></p>
                <p><em>In Canada, spicy chicken wings go <span style="color:#a64dff">hand in hand</span> with ice-cold beer. Another popular dish in Canada is Pancakes with maple syrup complemented with bacon and coffee.</em></p>
                <p><b>4.) Do you  keep track of calories (count calories) when you eat?</b></p>
                <p><em>I've been trying to lose weight for quite some time, so I try to count calories.  But, I have a <span style="color:#a64dff">sweet tooth</span>, which makes life difficult at times.</em></p><br>
                <h4 class="correct">Advanced:</h4>
                <p><b>1.)  How much do you roughly spend a month on groceries and do you prefer shopping at farmers markets or grocery stores?</b></p>
                <p><em>I spend about $600 a month on groceries to feed a family of four. I usually shop at grocery stores.  However, when the weather is nice and certain fruits and vegetables are <span style="color:#a64dff">in season</span>, I love to shop at farmers markets and get fresh food, while helping the local farming community.</em></p>
                <p><b>2.) What style of cuisine is starting to trend or increase in popularity?  Are <span style="color:#a64dff">fusion</span> restaurants popular in your country?</b></p>
                <p><em>I think American style pizza with Asian style toppings is starting to take off a lot in  Canada.  We have a growing Asian population that loves corn on their pizza.  Strange, I know!</em></p>
                <p><b>3.)  Have you ever had bad service in a restaurant? How did you handle the situation?  Did you <span style="color:#a64dff">make a scene</span> or complain to the staff? </b></p>
                <p><em>I'm not one to complain.  However, on one occasion I received food that was cold and didn't really look fresh.  I didn't want to make a scene, so I politely asked them to remake my order and there were no problems.</em></p>
