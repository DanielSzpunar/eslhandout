        <h4 class="babolevel">Sample Questions &amp; Answers:</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="correct">Beginner:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) What are the advantages of being a man in your culture?</b></p>
        <p><em>"Being a man in Canada doesn't really have many advantages over being a women in Canada.  Both sexes under the law have equal treatment and rights."</em></p>

        <p><b>2.) What are the disadvantages to being a man or woman in your culture?</b></p>
        <p><em>Even though men and women have equal rights under the law, men are still often expected to pay for women on dates, work longer hours, and do more physical work on the job.  I can't speak for women, though.</em></p>

        <p><b>3.) What jobs are associated with males in your culture? </b></p>
        <p><em>In Canada, men usually do jobs that require <span style="color:#a64dff">manual labour</span>. Construction workers are considered very masculine.</em></p>

        <p><b>4.) What jobs are associated with females in your culture?</b></p>
        <p><em>In Canada, women usually perform most jobs that work directly with children.  Nurses, daycare workers, and kindergarten teachers are usually considered <span style="color:#a64dff">feminine</span> jobs.</em></p>

        <p><b>5.) What are some actions that are not considered to be <span style="color:#a64dff">ladylike</span>  in your culture? </b></p>
        <p><em> Women who have a tendency to <span style="color:#a64dff">swear</span> and use <span style="color:#a64dff">profanity</span> are often seen as not very ladylike.  <span style="color:#a64dff">Spitting</span> is also not considered very ladylike. </em></p>

        <p><b>6.) What are some things that are not considered to be <span style="color:#a64dff">masculine</span> or "macho", in your culture?</b></p>
        <p><em>  Canada has become very liberal over the past few decades.  However, wearing makeup, and being very fashionable is not very masculine. Very fashionable men are often referred to as "<span style="color:#a64dff">metrosexuals</span>".</em></p>

        <p><b>7.) What are the responsibilities of men and women in the family?</b></p>
        <p><em> Men are usually expected to be the <span style="color:#a64dff">nine-to-fiver</span>,  while women are expected to be <span style="color:#a64dff">stay-at-home moms</span>.  However, the lines are starting to blur.  If the woman's salary is higher than the man's, the roles may switch.</em></p>

        <p><b>8.) If you are a man, are you attracted to tough independent women or more traditional roles associated with women?</b></p>
        <p><em>In my case, I've always been attracted to women who are more <span style="color:#a64dff">nurturing</span> and <span style="color:#a64dff">family oriented</span>. However, I still have a lot of respect for women who are career oriented and independent.</em></p>

        <br>
        <h4 class="correct">Intermediate:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) Has your culture made any significant changes regarding gender roles in society?  If so, please explain.</b></p>
        <p><em>As I already mentioned the lines between men and women's roles in society is no longer clearly defined.  Furthermore, Canada has become much more accepting of people with different <span style="color:#a64dff">sexual orientations</span>.  For example, the LGBT community is no longer <span style="color:#a64dff">ostracized</span> by society.</em></p>

        <p><b>2.) Which gender holds more top positions in your country workforce?</b></p>
        <p><em> Men still hold more top positions than women in Canada, but it's starting to change, especially in politics.  Men are more <span style="color:#a64dff">cutthroat</span> and competitive which are important characteristics of business professionals.</em></p>

        <h4 class="correct">Advanced:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) If you are a married man or woman, does your spouse allow you to have friends of the <span style="color:#a64dff">opposite sex</span>?</b></p>
        <p><em>While I'm not married, I do have a girlfriend who is Korean and I find her to be very jealous in certain situations.  While I've never hung out alone with female friends, I know for a fact she would disapprove.  </em></p>

        <p><b>2.) Are there any <span style="color:#a64dff">stereotypes</span> about women or men in your country?  If so, what are they, and do you believe there is a hint of truth to them?</b></p>
        <p><em>In Canada, women are considered to be terrible drivers.  Another common stereotype associated with women is they aren't good with money, and have a tendency to buy things on <span style="color:#a64dff">impulse</span>.    Yes, there is a hint of truth to these stereotypes, but don't tell my girlfriend I said that.</em></p>

        <h4 class="babolevel"><span style="color:#9579cb">Tips:</span></h4>
        <br>


        <p>1.) Even the best students sometimes say <span style="color:#cb7986">mens</span> or <span style="color:#cb7986">womens</span>. Remember, singular is man / woman and plural is men / women. There is no mens / womens.</p>
        <p>The only time we use the word men's in English is if we are looking for a section related to men. For example, <em>"Where is the <span style="color:#86cb79">men's</span> clothing section?"</em> or <em> "Where is the <span style="color:#86cb79">men's</span> change room?"</em></p>
