        <p><b>1.) When was the last time you went to a <span style="color:#a64dff">clinic</span>? What was the reason?</b></p>
        <p><em>I went to the clinic  for my annual check-up several weeks ago. </em></p>
        <p><b>2.) When was the last time you went to the hospital? What was the cause?</b></p>
        <p><em>I <span style="color:#a64dff">fractured</span> my ankle and <span style="color:#a64dff">bruised</span> it very bad.  So, I ended up needing surgery, and had to wear a <span style="color:#a64dff">cast</span> for four weeks.</em></p>
        <p><b>3.) Have you ever donated blood? If not, are you afraid of <span style="color:#a64dff">syringes</span>?</b></p>
        <p><em>I try to donate blood on a <span style="color:#a64dff">regular basis</span>.  I have no fear of needles.</em></p>
        <p><b>4.) When was the last time you had <span style="color:#a64dff">a physical</span>?  Did you receive a <span style="color:#a64dff">clean bill of health</span>?</b></p>
        <p><em> As I already mentioned, I got a physical several weeks ago.  I am very healthy, aside from my high blood pressure.</em></p>
        <p><b>5.) What are some <span style="color:#a64dff">home remedies</span> for a toothache? A stomachache? A headache?</b></p>
        <p><em>Rest is the best remedy.  However, for a toothache there is no <span style="color:#a64dff">quick fix</span>.</em></p>
        <p><b>6.) Did you suffer from any <span style="color:#a64dff">ailments</span> when you were a child?  Did you <span style="color:#a64dff">grow out of</span> them?</b></p>
        <p><em>I had allergies and I suffered from <span style="color:#a64dff">atopic dermatitis</span>.  Luckily I grew out of them.  Sometimes I get seasonal allergies in the spring, but <span style="color:#a64dff">over the counter medicine</span> clears it right up.</em></p>
        <p><b>7.) Have you ever been <span style="color:#a64dff">hospitalized</span> overnight?</b></p>
        <p><em> When I had surgery on my fractured ankle.  I spent three days in the hospital.</em></p>
        <p><b>8.) Do you get nausea easily (carsickness, seasickness)? </b></p>
        <p><em>I don't get nausea easily, thank God.</em></p>
        <p><b>9.) What changes have you noticed as you've begun to age?</b></p>
        <p><em>I need much longer to <span style="color:#a64dff">recuperate</span> from illness, and I am not as energetic as I used to be.</em></p>
        <p><b>10.) Do you take any vitamins or <span style="color:#a64dff">supplements</span>?</b></p>
        <p><em>I exercise regularly so I take a multi-vitamin, and I also take whey protein to <span style="color:#a64dff">retain</span> muscle mass.</em></p><br>

        <p><b>1.) Have you considered <span style="color:#a64dff">acupuncture</span>?  What do you think of Oriental medicine, is it effective?</b></p>
        <p><em>I've tried acupuncture.  I had no success.  I'm very <span style="color:#a64dff">skeptical</span> of Oriental medicine.</em></p>
        <p><b>2.) Do you have health insurance?  How much does health insurance cover in the case of illness?</b></p>
        <p><em>I have health insurance, my insurance covers 90% of costs <span style="color:#a64dff">incurred</span>.</em></p>
        <p><b>3.) Are you currently suffering from any injuries?  How is the recuperation process going?</b></p>

        <p><b>1.) Are there any <span style="color:#a64dff">genetic</span> or <span style="color:#a64dff">hereditary</span> illnesses in your family that you may have a <span style="color:#a64dff">predisposition</span> to? </b></p>
        <p><em>Fortunately not, actually, my father and grandfather are bald, so I guess I have a predisposition to baldness.</em></p>
        <p><b>2.) We know smoking is <span style="color:#a64dff">linked</span> to cancer.  However, do you think fast food is linked to diabetes?   Do you think vaccinations are linked to autism?</b></p>
        <p><em>I think vaccines are a necessity and  everything has risks. I don't think they are linked to autism.  However, I'm pretty sure too much fast food is a bad thing and will lead to diabetes in the long run.  You are what you eat!</em></p>
        <p><b>3.) Canadian lawmakers have passed a law to <span style="color:#a64dff">legalize</span> physician-assisted death.  What is the law in your country?  Do you think ill people should have the right to die if they so choose?</b></p>
        <p><em>I'm not sure about the current laws in my country.  However, I think people with a <span style="color:#a64dff">terminal illness</span> should have the right to decide whether they want to live or die.</em></p>
        <p><b>4.) What steps are you taking to ensure you healthy into your old age?</b></p>
        <p><em>I eat healthy, exercise regularly, and try to live a stress free life.  I stay away from <span style="color:#a64dff">toxic people</span> and try to surround myself with <span style="color:#a64dff">like-minded people</span>.</em></p>

        <br>
        <h4 class="babolevel">Tips:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) We use "sick" only when speaking generally about our overall health.  Therefore, <span style="color:#86cb79">"I am sick."</span> or <span style="color:#86cb79">"I feel sick."</span> or <span style="color:#86cb79">"You look sick."</span> can work. We do not say <span style="color:#cb7986"> "My leg is sick."</span> or <span style="color:#cb7986">"She has a sick stomach." </span> this sounds very strange in English. Instead we use the word "sore", or "hurts", or "is in pain".  <span style="color:#86cb79">"My legs are sore from hiking."</span> or <span style="color:#86cb79">"My arm hurts from when you punched me." </span>For stomach pain we can say: <span style="color:#86cb79">"I have an upset stomach."</span> or <span style="color:#86cb79">"I have a stomach ache."</span></b></p>
        <p><b>2.) Remember, we go to the <span style="color:#86cb79">"clinic"</span> or the <span style="color:#86cb79">"doctors office"</span> if it is not an emergency.  We go to the "hospital" if it is serious.  Many Koreans use the word "hospital" when, in fact, they just went to the doctors office. This causes foreigners to worry too much!</b></p>
        <p><b>3.) Remember, we <span style="color:#86cb79">"take" </span> medicine and we <span style="color:#86cb79">"take"</span> vitamins.  We do not <span style="color:#cb7986">"eat"</span> medicine or <span style="color:#cb7986">"eat"</span> vitamins. <em>I have to <span style="color:#86cb79">take </span> my medication three times a day following meals.</em></b></p><br>
