        <h4 class="correct">Beginner:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) What are you interested in? What are your hobbies?  What are your interests? (All three questions basically mean the same thing.)</b></p>
        <p><em>"I'm <span style="color:#a64dff">obsessed</span> with Japanese animation.  My friends <span style="color:#a64dff">tease</span> me a lot about it."</em></p>
        <p><b>2.) What do you do in your free time?</b></p>
        <p><em>"I love watching animation and downloading comics books.  I collect everything related to Naruto."</em></p>
        <p><b>3.) What are most people in your age group interested in?</b></p>
        <p><em>"I'd have to say most people in my age group are interested in watching videos online at sites like Youtube and Afreecatv."</em></p>
        <p><b>4.)  How long have your been watching animation for?</b></p>
        <p><em>I've been watching animation for over ten years.  "I've seen every <span style="color:#a64dff">episode</span> of Naruto from every <span style="color:#a64dff">season</span>.  I also love watching Naruto <span style="color:#a64dff">reruns</span>."</em></p>
        <p><b>5.)  What hobbies or interests did you used to have?  Why do you think you <span style="color:#a64dff">grew out of it</span>?</b></p>
        <p><em>"I was an <span style="color:#a64dff">avid</span> reader when I was younger. I guess I grew out of it because I didn't like being trapped up indoors."</em></p>
        <p><b>6.) Are there any hobbies you would like to explore in the future?</b></p>
        <p><em>"When I am <span style="color:#a64dff">financially stable</span>, I'd like to try deep sea fishing.  I'd love to own my own fishing boat one day."</em></p>

        <h4 class="correct">Intermediate:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) What are some interests or hobbies that are often associated with wealthy people?</b></p>
        <p><em>"That's <span style="color:#a64dff">hard to say</span> since I don't interact with people from those <span style="color:#a64dff">circles</span>."</em></p>
        <p><b>2.) What are some hobbies or activities that people with <span style="color:#a64dff">limited income</span> can enjoy in their free time?</b></p>
        <p><em>"Korea has many great bike trails and hiking trails to enjoy for free or at a very affordable price."</em></p>
        <p><b>3.) Tell me about some cool places to <span style="color:#a64dff">hang out</span> and kill some time.  Why is it cool?</b></p>
        <p><em>"My city has a popular <span style="color:#a64dff">district</span> associated with university and college students.  It's popular because you can get some good food at a good price and find some really <span style="color:#a64dff">cozy</span> bars that offer a wide variety of draft beer."</em></p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="correct">Advanced:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) Do you have an <span style="color:#a64dff">artistic</span> side?  Are you <span style="color:#a64dff">musically inclined</span>?  </b></p>
        <p><em>I have no inclination towards music, due to my <span style="color:#a64dff">stubby</span> fingers.</em></p>
        <p><b>2.) Some people love arts and crafts.  How is your handwriting? Have you ever tried <span style="color:#a64dff">calligraphy</span>?</b></p>
        <p><em>  I have excellent penmanship.  However, no one really writes letters anymore.</em></p>
        <p><b>3.)  While many people don't have hobbies they are active within their community.  Are you a member of any clubs or programs?  Do you volunteer?</b></p>
        <p><em> I volunteer at an <span style="color:#a64dff">orphanage </span> several times a month and I used to volunteer at an animal shelter.  I think helping people comes first.</em></p>
