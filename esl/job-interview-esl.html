        <h4 class="babolevel">Sample Questions &amp; Answers:</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="correct">Beginner:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) Please, tell me a little bit about yourself?</b></p>
        <p><em> As you know, I'm a recent graduate from the university of Toronto, majoring in computer sciences. I have always had a passion for computers and technology since I got my first computer as a kid.  I have been coding ever since.  When I am not programming I enjoy photography and studying language I am <span style="color:#a64dff">proficient</span> in both English and French.  I also love exercise and lifting weights.</em></p>

        <p><b>2.)  Tell me about your previous work history?</b></p>
        <p><em>I have spent the last three years as a <span style="color:#a64dff"> freelance</span> web developer creating small web applications and working on the weekends as a wedding photographer.  <span style="color:#a64dff">Prior</span> to that, I worked overseas teaching English.</em></p>

        <p><b>3.) What are some of your strengths?</b></p>
        <p><em>I have a <span style="color:#a64dff">knack</span> for design.  Being a photographer and designer I can help create logos, mix and match design patterns and colors, and I've been told I can write clearly and <span style="color:#a64dff">concisely</span>.</em></p>

        <p><b>4.) What are some of your weaknesses?</b></p>
        <p><em>I haven't worked on a lot of big programming projects with many team members.  This is  my main weakness.  </em></p>

        <p><b>5.) Tell me a few of your personal <span style="color:#a64dff">achievements</span>?</b></p>
        <p><em>I have created several websites that earn <span style="color:#a64dff">passive-income</span>.  While I can't retire on the earnings it allows me to save for my future.  Another accomplishment of mine that I am truly proud of is my ability to speak several languages.  It has been very helpful in dealing with overseas clients and travel. </em></p>

        <p><b>6.) How do you work under pressure?</b></p>
        <p><em>I try to avoid stressful situations by planning in advance and always being ahead of schedule.  However, clients often change their wants and needs and I've been able to <span style="color:#a64dff">adapt</span> quite well.</em></p>
        <!--  <img src="../img/ajuma.jpg" class="pic img-responsive img-rounded pic" alt="A photo of a South Korean woman wearing a traditional Hanbok dress.">-->

        <br>
        <h4 class="correct">Intermediate:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) What working environment do you work best in?</b></p>
        <p><em>I work best having strict guidelines to follow. If I am in charge, I like others to follow my decisions without <span style="color:#a64dff">hesitation</span>.  However, if I am not in charge of a project I have no problem following orders and guidelines.  </em></p>

        <p><b>2.) Are you willing to relocate overseas or travel abroad on business?</b></p>
        <p><em>I have spent several years living in both Europe and Asia.  I have no problem relocating overseas.  Actually, one of the main reasons why I am interested in working for your company is that there are opportunities to work overseas!</em></p>

        <p><b>3.) What is important to you from an employer?</b></p>
        <p><em>I think what is most important from an employer is the ability to recognize and reward hard work.  I like to go <span style="color:#a64dff">above and beyond</span> what is expected in the workplace, and I want my employer or clients to recognize that. </em></p>

        <p><b>4.) What do you know about our company?  Why do you want to work for us?</b></p>
        <p><em>I know that this company is a leader in developing <span style="color:#a64dff">personalized</span> software for medium and large size companies.  For that reason I know that I will be challenged as a software engineer and will face some difficult problems to solve as a member of a team.</em></p>
        <p><em>I have been following the growth of this company for the past several years and admire how this company has been able to <span style="color:#a64dff">evolve</span> and meet the software needs of companies throughout North America and Europe.  </em></p>

        <p><em>For this reason I know if I work hard I will always have a secure  and challenging job at this company.  </em></p><br>

        <h4 class="correct">Advanced:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) Describe for me a difficult situation you were faced with.  How did you overcome the problematic situation?</b></p>
        <p><em>One of the most difficult situations I was faced with was when I was  developing a mobile app for a company.  The CEO of the company was <span style="color:#a64dff">reluctant</span> to take my advice and create an app that had the possibility to meet the needs of a larger user-base.  He was convinced that it was unnecessary to create such a large database. </em></p>
        <p><em>In the end, I had to refuse the project because I  felt unsatisfied with my work and the outcome.</em></p>

        <p><b>3.) Do you prefer working with others as a part of a team, or do you prefer working alone? </b></p>
        <p><em>I work well in both circumstances.  However, recently I prefer working as a member of a team.  I feel it allows for more creativity, <span style="color:#a64dff"> brainstorming</span> and feedback, which create an atmosphere with better results.</em></p>

        <p><b>4.) Why did you chose your major in university?  Do you have any regrets about your educational path?</b></p>
        <p><em>I am very fortunate to have chosen a major that I not only love, but also is in high-demand.  I always knew that the problems of the future would require computers and technology to solve them, and I want to be a part of that.</em></p>
