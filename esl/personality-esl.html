        <h4 class="correct">Beginner:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) What kind of person would you describe yourself as? </b></p>
        <p><em>I would describe myself as an <span style="color:#a64dff">easy-going</span> person.  I tend to be <span style="color:#a64dff">reserved</span> at first but once I get to know you, I become more <span style="color:#a64dff">outgoing</span>.</em></p>
        <p><b>2.) Do you <span style="color:#a64dff">take after</span> anyone in your family? </b></p>
        <p><em>I take after my father.  We both have a <span style="color:#a64dff">short-temper</span>.  </em></p>
        <p><b>3.) What makes you most happy in your life?</b></p>
        <p><em>When I'm stress free at home doing nothing, is when I am the happiest.</em></p>
        <p><b>4.) What makes you the most sad in your life?</b></p>
        <p><em>Monday mornings fill my life with sadness.  </em></p>
        <p><b>5.) Which situations cause you to feel most shy? Why? </b></p>
        <p><em>Formal situations like weddings, and family reunions always make me feel shy and act <span style="color:#a64dff">awkward</span>.</em></p>
        <p><b>6.) What do you enjoy doing in your alone time? </b></p>
        <p><em>I rarely have the opportunity to spend time with just myself.  <span style="color:#a64dff">If given the chance</span>, I love to listen to audio books and go for walks.  I like to keep things as simple as possible.</em></p>
        <p><b>7.) What do you enjoy doing when you are with your friends?</b></p>
        <p><em>My friends and I are <span style="color:#a64dff">geeks</span>. When we get together we play video games.  We are not into <span style="color:#a64dff">manly</span> things, like sports. </em></p>
        <p><b>8.) What are you working on improving with regards to your personality?</b></p>
        <p><em>I'm trying to be more <span style="color:#a64dff">open-minded</span>.  Many people tend to think I'm very conservative and <span style="color:#a64dff">narrow-minded</span>.  It has to do with my <span style="color:#a64dff">upbringing</span>.</em></p><br>

        <h4 class="correct">Intermediate:</h4>

        <p><b>1.) How would you describe your <span style="color:#a64dff">upbringing</span>?  Did it influence your personality?</b></p>
        <p><em>I had a fairly normal childhood. However, my father was very <span style="color:#a64dff">strict</span> and often enforced <span style="color:#a64dff">corporal punishment</span>?</em></p>
        <p><b>2.) What personality <span style="color:#a64dff">traits</span> do you consider important in a friend?  How about  a boss?</b></p>
        <p><em>I'd say an important <span style="color:#a64dff">quality</span> a friend must have is they must have a good sense of humour and be lighthearted, whereas a boss must be serious and professional.</em></p>
        <p><b>3.) Would you consider yourself more <span style="color:#a64dff">introverted</span> or <span style="color:#a64dff">extroverted</span>? </b></p>
        <p><em>I definitely prefer spending time alone or with close friends.  So, I'm definitely an introvert.</em></p>
        <p><b>4.) Would you consider yourself <span style="color:#a64dff">optimistic</span> or <span style="color:#a64dff">pessimistic</span> about your future (glass half empty or glass half full)? </b></p>
        <p><em></em></p><br>

        <h4 class="correct">Advanced:</h4>
        <p><b>1.)  Do you think birth order influences personality?</b></p>
        <p><em>Being the second born son in my family, nothing I do garners the same attention or reaction as that of the families first born son. <span style="color:#a64dff">I live in the shadow of</span> my older brother.</em></p>
        <p><b>2.) Do you have any <span style="color:#a64dff">mannerisms</span> or habits that others might have noticed about you.</b></p>
        <p><em>I constantly bite my nails and <span style="color:#a64dff">twirl</span> my hair when under stress, or in uncomfortable situations. It's something I'm working on.</em></p>
        <p><b>3.) What is something that get's <span style="color:#a64dff">under your skin</span> (slang: pisses you off)?</b></p>
        <p><em>Although I was a smoker for half my life I cannot stand the smell of cigarettes. I cannot <span style="color:#a64dff">fathom</span> how anyone would ever kiss an ashtray.</em></p>
        <p><b>4.) How does your culture treat those who have awkward personalities?  Do you work with any strange or unique people?  Do you get along well?</b></p>
        <p><em>Since Canada is a very multicultural country many people fall into the category of unique or strange.  I think the word "strange" has a negative <span style="color:#a64dff">connotation</span> when describing someone, but I do work with a few unique people.  At first it was uncomfortable, but eventually they <span style="color:#a64dff">grew on me</span>.</em></p>
