        <h4 class="babolevel">Sample Questions &amp; Answers:</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="correct">Beginner:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) What would you change in your life if you had an opportunity?</b></p>
        <p><em>I would love to change my job.  I feel it's going nowhere, and there is no <span style="color:#a64dff">room for growth</span>.  I wish I had a career with more opportunities.</em></p>

        <p><b>2.) What's your biggest regret?</b></p>
        <p><em>I'd have to say my biggest regret was not taking my education seriously.  You know what they say, <span style="color:#a64dff">hindsight is 20/20</span>.</em></p>

        <p><b>3.) When did you realize you were an adult?</b></p>
        <p><em> When I was 16 and got my first speeding ticket.  I had to go to court to appeal my ticket.  I lost and paid my first fine. </em></p>

        <p><b>4.) What's your earliest memory?</b></p>
        <p><em>Playing the original Nintendo when I was nine years old with my older brother at Christmas. Childhood seems so long ago.</em></p>

        <p><b>5.) Have you ever lived alone? What was the transition like from being dependent to becoming independent?</b></p>
        <p><em>Yes, I've been living alone since I was 18 years old.  The transition was extremely <span style="color:#a64dff"> laborious</span>.  I had to <span style="color:#a64dff">juggle</span> school, work, and house chores, all while living on a frugal budget.</em></p>


        <!--  <img src="../img/ajuma.jpg" class="pic img-responsive img-rounded pic" alt="A photo of a South Korean woman wearing a traditional Hanbok dress.">-->

        <br>
        <h4 class="correct">Intermediate:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) What were some struggles <span style="color:#a64dff">you faced</span> transitioning from high school to university?</b></p>
        <p><em>The biggest struggle was managing my own time.  During high school you always have someone <span style="color:#a64dff">keeping an eye on you</span>.  However, in university it's up to you to stay on top of things.</em></p>

        <p><b>2.) What do you think the biggest transition people in your culture face?</b></p>
        <p><em>As a Canadian, I'd argue that having and raising children is the biggest transition people in my culture face. Having children forces people to grow up and take responsibility  for their lives and those of their children. </em></p>

        <h4 class="correct">Advanced:</h4>
        <p><b>1.) Has your company <span style="color:#a64dff">implemented</span> any serious transitions to improve?</b></p>
        <p><em>Recently, our company made the transition to offer our products not only through retail but also online within Canada and overseas.  The transition has been <span style="color:#a64dff">costly</span>.  However, over the long-term our company remains <span style="color:#a64dff">optimistic</span> about our decisions.</em></p>

        <p><b>2.) When you transition from being a working adult to retirement, how will you take advantage of your newly acquired free time?  Do you have any ideas? Or is that too far away to even think about?</b></p>
        <p><em>  I would love to renew my passion for music and I would love to take up art.  I would also consider living in a different country for a while  to really experience a new culture and way of life!</em></p>
